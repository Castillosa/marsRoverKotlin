## Mars Rovers

Implementation of mars rover [Kata](http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata)


Requirements
- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands. (pd: using String for easy implementation, not so perfomance lost xD)
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
